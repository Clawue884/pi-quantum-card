# System Architecture Overview

## Introduction
This document provides an overview of the architecture of the PQC (Post-Quantum Cryptography) system. The architecture is designed to be modular, scalable, and secure, leveraging modern technologies and best practices.

## Components
1. **Frontend**: 
   - Built with React.js, providing a responsive user interface.
   - Communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs.

2. **Backend**: 
   - Node.js and Express.js for handling API requests.
   - Implements business logic and interacts with the database.
   - Utilizes JWT for authentication and authorization.

3. **Database**: 
   - MongoDB for storing user data, transactions, and rewards.
   - Mongoose for object data modeling (ODM).

4. **Blockchain Layer**: 
   - Smart contracts deployed on Ethereum (or another blockchain).
   - Handles transactions and rewards distribution securely.

5. **Utilities**: 
   - Various utility modules for logging, error handling, encryption, and QR code generation.

## Data Flow
1. The user interacts with the frontend application.
2. The frontend sends requests to the backend API.
3. The backend processes the requests, interacts with the database, and communicates with the blockchain layer if necessary.
4. Responses are sent back to the frontend for user display.

## Security Considerations
- All sensitive data is encrypted.
- User authentication is managed via JWT.
- Regular security audits and updates are performed.

## Conclusion
The architecture of the PQC system is designed to be robust, secure, and maintainable, ensuring a seamless experience for users and developers alike.
