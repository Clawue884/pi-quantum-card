# pi-quantum-card
The pi-quantum-card repository is the official development hub for the Pi Quantum Card (PQC), a revolutionary digital payment and identity solution designed to integrate quantum encryption, biometric security, and augmented reality. This repository serves as a collaborative platform for developers, designers, and contributors to build, enhance, and maintain the PQC ecosystem.

# Pi Quantum Card

## Overview

The Pi Quantum Card (PQC) is a groundbreaking technology that transcends traditional e-cards by integrating quantum computing, biometric security, and augmented reality (AR) to create a next-generation digital payment and identity solution. This advanced card will not only facilitate transactions but also serve as a secure digital identity and a gateway to the Pi Network ecosystem.

## Features

- **Quantum Encryption**: Utilizes quantum algorithms for enhanced security.
- **Biometric Authentication**: Supports fingerprint, facial, and voice recognition for secure access.
- **Dynamic QR Codes**: Generate and scan QR codes for seamless transactions.
- **Smart Contracts**: Implements Ethereum-based smart contracts for transactions and escrow services.
- **Loyalty and Rewards System**: Manage and track user rewards and loyalty programs.
- **Augmented Reality Interface**: Provides an interactive AR experience for users.
